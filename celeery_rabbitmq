Starting/Stopping the RabbitMQ server
To start the server:

$ sudo rabbitmq-server
you can also run it in the background by adding the -detached option (note: only one dash):

$ sudo rabbitmq-server -detached
Never use kill to stop the RabbitMQ server, but rather use the rabbitmqctl command:

$ sudo rabbitmqctl stop
